倒装句
1、什么是倒装句？
    陈述：
        The teacher comes here. 主 + 谓 + 地点状语
    倒装：
        跟陈述相对，在陈述语序下，本应该放在后面的句子成分被拿到前面去了，就是倒装。
        比如，Here comes the teacher. 地点状语 + 谓 + 主
2、为什么要有倒装句？
    （1）强调句首的部分。
        "Here" comes the teacher.
        "Never" will I forget you.
        "Ugly" as/though I am,I am gentle.
    （2）平衡句子结构。
        英语不喜欢头重脚轻，当一个主语太长时就会长长的主语往后移，其他成分就会往前提。
        倒：Then came "the hour we had been looking forward to".
        陈："The hour we had been looking forward to" came then.
3、倒装句的三种形式。
    3.1、全部倒装（完全倒装）：整个谓语都拿到主语之前。
        全部倒装 = 某些句子成分 + 谓 + 主
        倒：Here comes the teacher. 状 + 谓 + 主
        陈：The teacher comes here. 主 + 谓 + 状
        全部倒装必须要满足一下要求：
            （1）谓语动词为不及物动词。
            （2）主语必须是名词，不能是代词。
        注意如果主语非要是代词，则主谓语序不变：
            对：Here you are.       错：Here are you.
            对：There she comes.    错：There comes she.
        3.1.1、There be 句型。
            There be + 某物/人 + 某地/时‌，表示某地/时有某物/人。
            There is a book on the desk.
            There are some flowers in the garden.
            There was a party last night. 
            There were many people at the party last night.
            倒：There is sth.   
            陈：Sth. is there.
            同样，如果主语是人称代词，则主谓语序不变。
            对：There you are.      错：There are you.
        3.1.2、here，there，now，then，next位于句首。
            谓语动词多为be，lie，come，go等表示存在去向的词。
            Here comes the old lady!
            There goes the bell.
            Then came the hour we had been looking forward to.
            Now comes your turn.
            Next comes your turn.
            同样，如果主语是人称代词，则主谓语序不变。
            对：Here you are.       错：Here are you.
            对：There she comes.    错：There comes she.
        3.1.3、out，in，up，down位于句首。
            谓语动词为come，go，rush，run，walk等表示去向的词。
            In came Mr.White.
            Out rushed the girl.
            Up went the arrow into the air.
            Away went the boy.
            同样，如果主语是人称代词，则主谓语序不变。
            In he came.
            Out she rushed.
        3.1.4、表示地点的介词词组位于句首。
            谓语动词为be，lie，stand，sit，stop等表示存在状态的词。
            "At the foot of the hill" lies a beautiful lake.
            "East of the lake" lie two towns.
            "Under the tree" sat a wounded soldier.
            同样，如果主语是人称代词，则主谓语序不变。
            Under the tree he sat.
        3.1.5、表语位于句首。
            系动词均为be动词，主语必须为名词，不可为代词。
            （1）表语为介词短语
               "Among the goods" are Christmas trees,flower,candles,and toys.
            （2）表语为形容词
                "Present at the meeting" were Mr.White and many other guests.
            （3）表语为过去分词
                "Seated on the ground" are a group of young people.
            （4）表语为表示进行时态的现在分词
                "Lying on the floor" was a boy.
                "Standing beside the desk" was a teacher.
            （5）表语为Such
                "Such" were her words.
                "Such" was what she said.
            （6）表示祝愿
                "Long" live Chairman Mao.
    3.2、部分倒装（不完全倒装/半倒装）：仅仅只把谓语中的助动词拿到主语之前，实义动词还在主语之后。
        部分倒装 = 某些句子成分 + 助动词 + 主 + 实义动词（部分倒装几乎都是为了强调放在句子句首的成分）
        倒：Never will I forget you. 状 + 助动词 + 主 + 谓 + 宾
        陈：I will never forget you. 主 + 助动词 + 状 + 谓 + 宾
        3.2.1、so,neither/nor + 助动词 + 主。（强调也是，或也不是）
            He has been to Beijing.So have I (been to Beijing).
            Tom can't answer the question.Neither/Nor can I (answer the question).
            没有明显的助动词，加一个do的变形。
            I love English and so does my sister.
            正常来说后面的谓语应该与前面一致，但是如果前面的是两个谓语，那么
            She "is" a teacher and "works" at the college."So it is with" Li Ming.或者"It is the same with" Li Ming.
            正常来说前面谓语表肯定后面用so，前面谓语表否定后面用neither或nor，但是如果前面谓语既有肯定又有否定，那么
            She "isn't" a teacher but she "works" at the college."So it is with" Li Ming.或者"It is the same with" Li Ming.
        3.2.2、否定词或半否定词 + 助动词 + 主语 + 实义动词。
            否定词或半否定词：never，little，seldom，rarely，hardly，by no means，in no way，in no case，under no circumstance，at no time.
            "Little" does she know about French.
            "Seldom" have I met Mr.Green in the campus.
            "At no time" will I hurt her.
            "By no means" can you smoke here.
            （1）Not until + 时间词/时间状语从句 + 助动词 + 主语 + 实义动词 + 其他成分。
                倒：Not until she read the letter did she know the fact.
                陈：She did not know the fact until she read the letter.
                倒：Not until he fails the exam will he realize the importance of studying.
                陈：He won't realize the importance of studying until he fails the exam.
            （2）一....就...。
                倒：No sooner had sb. done A than B.
                陈：Sb. had no sooner done A than B.
            （3）刚...就...。
                倒：Hardly/Scarcely had sb. done A when B.
                陈：Sb. had hardly/scarcely done A when B.
            （4）不仅...而且...
                Not only + 分句（部分倒装）,but also + 分句（不到装）.
                Not only does she play sports well,but also she is good at studying.
        3.2.3、Only + 状语（副词/介词短语/状语从句）位于句首。
            Only + 状语 + 助动词 + 主语 + 实义动词 + 其他成分.
            副词作状语
            Only then did I realize the importance of math.
            介词短语作状语
            Only by this means is it possible to explain it.
            状语从句
            Only when the war was over in 1918 was he able to get happily back to work.
        3.2.4、so/such引导的短语放在句首。
            So/Such + 形容词/副词/名词 + 助动词 + 主语 + 实义动词 + that从句.
            So "loudly" did he speak that even people in the next room could hear him.
            Such "a good job" did I get that I couldn't help laughing.
        3.2.5、在虚拟语气条件句中，were，had，should移到主语之前，成为部分倒装。
            虚拟语气的部分倒装并不是为了强调什么，仅仅只是为了让句子更简洁。
            If I were you,I would go with her. -> Were I you,I would go with her.
        3.2.6、May开头表示祝愿。
            仅了解。
            May you return soon.
    3.3、形式倒装：把表语拿到主语之前。
        倒：Ugly though I am,I am gentle. 表 + 状 + 主 + 系，主 + 谓 + 宾
        陈：Though I am ugly,I am gentle. 状 + 主 + 系 + 表，主 + 谓 + 宾
        3.3.1、as/though引导的让步状语从句。
            倒："Ugly" as/though I am,I am gentle.
            陈：Though I am,I am gentle.（这里不能用as开头了，因为as没有虽然，尽管的意思）
            这个句式前面能强调名词，形容词，副词，动词，分词
            即，名词/形容词/副词/动词/分词 + as/though + 主 + 其他.
            名词：
                倒：Child as/though he is,he has to make a living.
                陈：Though he is a child,he has to make a living.
            副词：

            动词：
                倒：Try as/though I might,I could not lift the box.
                陈：Though I might try,I could not lift the box.
            分词：
                倒：Raning hard as/though it is,I am going out for a walk.
                陈：Though it is raining hard,I am going out for a walk.
        3.3.2、however，whatever引导的让步状语从句。
            这里的倒装句是不能还原成陈述句的。
            （1）However + 形容词 + 主语 + 谓语 + 主句.
                However difficult the problem may be,we must working it out this evening.
            （2）Whatever + 名词 + 主语 + 谓语 + 主句.
                Whatever reasons you have,you should carry out your promise.

            （1）How + 形容词 + 主语 + 谓语.
                How interesting their talk is!
            （2）What + 名词/名词短语 + 主语 + 谓语.
